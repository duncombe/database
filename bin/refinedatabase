# when we use =combinedatabase= to merge two databases, we have two copies of the elements copied. 
# If we no longer want the elements copied to be in the original database, we need to scan the original 
# database and eliminate data no longer required. 
# 

# run combinedatabase 
# 	copy in blobs
# 	update catalogue
# 	create accession links in destination database
# remove the accession links from the origin database
# 	remove blob if it is no longer in catalogue
