# when we use =combinedatabase= to merge two databases, we have two copies of the elements copied. 
# If we no longer want the elements copied to be in the original database, we need to scan the original 
# database and eliminate data no longer required. 
# 

# run combinedatabase
# remove the accesion links from the origin database
# scan all accession links in the origin database
# remove blobs in the database (.DATABASE) no longer pointed to.
