# read a catalog and link files from the database to a WAF 

# We are changing the format of the WAF.
# It was
# DATA/
#      ACCESSION/
#                {UUID}/
#                       {original-data-folder}/
#
# We want this to become
# DATA/
#      ACCESSION/
#                {UUID}/
#                       ABOUT/

#                       1-DATA/{modified-data-folder}/
# 
# So we have to make allowance for:
#     1. an additional level of linking
#     2. specifying what version of the data we are writing
#            

# export CATALOG=`pwd`/test-catalog1
