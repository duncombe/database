title	This is a Title for the dataset, something reasonably descriptive, with some additional information making it useful and even possibly unique.  
abstract	This is an abstract about the data. It could be some short information about where, when, why, who, how in a pleasant readable form. Unfortunately for this file it must not have paragraphs or new lines, unless we can code that in with some \n exciting \n escape \n codes. \n
