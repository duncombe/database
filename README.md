# database

A test suite for creating an accession in a simple database.  Includes
rudimentary tools to assign UUIDs, calculate SHA checksums and add files to the
database (from a set of web-accessible folders (WAFs)).  This initial pass at
the problem is intended to create an emergency database that can easily be
incorporated into a more mature product as one becomes available.

## Workflow

Ingest flow is anticipated to be as follows:

1. A i**set of data** is acquired, consisting of files arranged in some provider-defined directory structure. Files may be of any type.
Metadata as txt, XML, or JSON files may or may not be present.  
In ISO-14721 terminology, this suite is termed a **Submission Information Package** (SIP).
2. The SIP is assigned an **accession number**.
   1. The accession number is proposed to be of the form YYYYMMDD=UUID, with the first eight digits indicating the date that the dataset was ingested 
into the system, and the next following digits, a universally unique identifier. 
1. The UUID (accession number) and accession-level metadata are stored in an **accession information table**, ultimately as a SQL database,
initially in a TSV manifest. For the sake of redundancy and guarding against database corruption, the TSV manifest will be maintained. 
1. The SIP directory structure is read. 
1. Each subdirectory is also assigned a UUID, since each may represent a (related) dataset, e.g., `CRUISE1/CTD`, `CRUISE1/ADCP`.
1. For each file in the SIP,  the 384-bit Secure Hash Algorithm checksum, SHASUM-384,  is calculated and 
the file inserted into a database structure, `${DATABASE}/` such that the path name of each file can be reduced to the SHASUM, 
e.g., a file with SHASUM-384 of 
`38b060a751ac96384cd9327eb1b1e36a21fdb71114be07434c0cc7bf63f6e1da274edebfe76f65fbd51ad2f14898b95b`
would be stored as   
`${DATABASE}/38/b060a751ac96384cd9327eb1b1e36a21fdb71114be07434c0cc7bf63f6e1da274edebfe76f65fbd51ad2f14898b95b`. 
1. The SHASUMs and original pathnames are recorded in the manifest as children of the accession ID.
1. The TSV manifest is committed to a git repository.
    1. The manifest table has the parent accession ID, the sub-directory UUID, the file SHASUM, the original filename and path.  
    1. Where is the metadata for the SIP? There should be 
```
	Producer Title Abstract Date Time UUID Accession Fileslist
```
 etc. 
1. Publication database is constructed by making symlinks to `$DATABASE`.
1. Metadata database includes xlinks to `$DATABASE`. 

## Database Structure

The database structure is proposed to look like this:

## Metadata Conventions

Intend to conform to ISO-19115-series. Note that SAN-1878, defining placenames and features specific to South Africa is in essence a sub-set of ISO-19115. 
Note that SAEON has been accepted (by international organizations) as the regional representative for the issuing of Digital Object Identifiers and has 
registered with DataCite to do this. In order for us to obtain DOIs we do so through SAEON. Once our own information management system is functional, the 
process will involve lodging a copy of our metadata with SAEON, who issues us a DOI for the data set and points at our servers as the responsible sourcex 
for the data set described by the DOI.  DataCite requires a certain subset of metadata to be provided in order to issue a DOI. In addition to any other 
metadata that we ourselves may require we will have to provide this minimum subset in order to obtain a DOI from DataCite through SAEON for our data. 

The following table is taken from SAEON document G387.3.1.1 Meta.

| ID | Group | DataCite | Required | Element or Property | Comment and Guidance|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Citation | M | Yes | Identifier (with type sub‚Äêproperty) | Always a DOI in this context, issued by SAEON |
| 2 | Citation | M | Yes | Creator | Several sub-properties, such as Name, ORCID reference, etc. |
| 3 | Citation | M | Yes | Title | The title of the digital object |
| 4 | Citation | M | Yes | Publisher | The publisher of the digital object |
| 5 | Citation | M | Yes | Publication Year | The year in which the digital object was published |
| 6 | Discovery | R | Yes(1) | Subject | Subject, keyword, classification code, or key phrase describing the resource. If controlled vocabularies are used, the authority can be referenced. |
| 7 | Citation | R | Yes | Contributor | Contributors that need to be acknowledged, with a set of predefined roles assocaited with the named persons or institutions. |
| 8 | Discovery | R | Yes | Dates | The date coverage of the work: applicable date range(s) for the data. |
| 9 | Re-Use | O | No | Language | Assumed English if not provided |
| 10 | Re-Use | R | Yes | Resource Type | Free text and controlled list combination describing the type of digital object |
| 11 | Re-Use | O | Yes | Alternate Identifier | The unqiue identifier (UID) issued by the depositor. This is mandatory in our context since SAEON must maintain synchronisation between DOIs and UIDs |
| 12 | Re-Use | R | No | Related Identifier | Links to other identifiers, such as handles, ISBN numbers, and so on. Recommended if it exists. Mandatory for replacement versions of the same data. |
| 13 | Re-Use | O | No | Size | Guidance for potential users. |
| 14 | Re-Use | O | No | Format | Can be free text, but a MIME type is recommended |
| 15 | Re-Use | O | Yes | Version | Version issued by depositor. In SAEON context, mandatory since SAEON must synchronise DOIs and versions. |
| 16 | Re-Use | O | Yes | Rights | Recommended that Creative Commons licenses be used. |
| 17 | Re-Use | R | Yes | Description | Any other technical information. Suggested use is for an abstract. |
| 18 | Discovery | R | Yes(2) | GeoLocation | Can be one or more point or bounding box references, using decimal Lat-Long coordinates. Mandatory if applicable to the data.  | 

M - mandatory    
R - recommended    
O - optional    

It is recommended by SAEON (and we should consider making it mandatory for our datasets) that standard vocabularies be used. If a standard vocabulary for 
your discipline does not exist, consider defining one and using it. 
Appropriate conventions are: the Climate and Forecast conventions (CF), ACDD, etc.


## Glossary

*accession* is a bunch of related files.   
*collection* has no data: a superset describing a bunch of related accessions   
*dataset* informal term - often maps to accession, not always.
