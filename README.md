# database

A test suite for loading data into a simple database.
Includes rudimentary tools to assign UUIDs and add files to a database
(from a set of web-accessible folders (WAFs))  and create a catalog of
SHA checksums and UUIDs. This initial pass at the problem is intended to 
create an emergency database that can be improved upon or completely
changed as more sophisticated tools are developed or obtained.

## Workflow 

Ingest flow is anticipated to be as follows:

1. A data collection is acquired consisting of files arranged in some provider 
defined directory
structure. Files may be of any type. Metadata in XML or JSON files may or
may not be present.  
1. The collection is assigned a collection number.    
    1. The collection number should be of the form YYYYMMDDHHMMSS, indicating the
date and time the dataset was acquired.
1. The collection is assigned a UUID. 
1. The UUID and collection metadata are stored in a collection table     
    1. initially in a TSV ascii table    
    2. later converted to SQL table database. 
1. The directory structure is read. 
1. For each file in the collection,  the `SHASUM -a384`  is calculated and 
the file copied to a second database structure, `${DATABASE}/` such that the
path name of each file can be reduced to the SHASUM, e.g., a file with shasum
of 
`38b060a751ac96384cd9327eb1b1e36a21fdb71114be07434c0cc7bf63f6e1da274edebfe76f65fbd51ad2f14898b95b`
will be stored as   
`${DATABASE}/38/b0/60/a751ac96384cd9327eb1b1e36a21fdb71114be07434c0cc7bf63f6e1da274edebfe76f65fbd51ad2f14898b95b`. 
1. A UUID is assigned to each file in the second database and added
to another files table in the MySQL database. 
    1. The files table has the collection ID, the shasum, the file UUID, the original filename and path, and the name of an XML file that holds the metadata for that file.
